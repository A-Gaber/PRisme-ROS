# PRisme Simulation

This projects aims at developing a comprehensive realistic simulation environment for Robopolyâ€™s PRisme robotics platform. It is based on ROS, a hassle-free robotics framework, and Gazebo, a powerful simulation software.

One might use this as a base for the simulation of a more advanced robot by modifying its physical description or by adding new sensors. It can also be considered as an educational tool for the study of robotics software and algorithms in applications such as localisation or path planing without the need to access the physical robot.

## Scope

Software development is particularly difficult in robotics, as the execution of the code (the application) highly depends on the proper functioning of the hardware (mechanics and electronics).

Robotics simulations aim at tackling this problem by making robot software development less dependent on the actual physical hardware. This allows to split tasks among the development team, increasing time-efficiency.

The ROS framework brings this further, by providing a way to develop software portions as computational units (*nodes*) that can be ran and tested independently from each other.
